I designed a login and a home page using bootstrap and view engine in ruby on rails.
I learned how to validate the username and password at the server side with a predefined value.
I secured the access to the home page by displaying an incorrect username or password message on the login page if the credentials were wrong.
I added a signout button on the home page that would redirect to the login page when clicked.
I ensured that the session handling worked properly and that the signout would not happen unless the user pressed the signout button. I also made sure that the home page would not be loaded on pressing the back button after signing out.
